# QuestChain

# holds a series of quest targets
# each quest target may have requirements
# if those requirements are met, the next item in the quest chain is produced

# quest chains may contain events, cutscenes, or new quest targets

# each one should have a "finished" method, to return to the chain.

# Quest Chains allow human quest designers to create quests.
# Quest targets allow in-game player to advance quests
